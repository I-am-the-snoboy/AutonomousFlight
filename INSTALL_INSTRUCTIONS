Install mavlink_ros package in mavlink worspace created
Installed mavros github and followed installation instructions for kinetic
deleted all workspaces and reinstalled mavros package, which recompiles mavlink libraries as well
downloaded boost library and unzipped it, not sure if necessary for compiling c++ code, but after rebuilding mavros packages, they compiled with no errors
ran source devel/setup.sh in catkin_ws to source the mav_ros package
using pi3 and navio to broadcast wifi
use desktop computer that is connected with ethernet to the pi wifi
ssh to the pi from the desktop
downloaded APM Planner 2.0 as a ground control station onto personal laptop
connect laptop to pi wifi
run arductoper on pi with ip address of laptop to see pi connected to APM Planner
to run arducopter use command:
sudo ./ArduCopter.elf -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550 where the ip is the ip address of the device with the ground control station i.e. my laptop

Deleted mavros packages that was trying to compile from source code, because has bizarre to_string error in mavlink with no apparent fix. Posted in forum, so far no response. 

Decided to compile the binary from the mavros wiki. It downloaded. https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/master/mavros/README.md#installation

Attached pi/navio to desktop computer with USB to df13 cable. 

Had to figure out what the device was called. To troubelshoot this, look at ls /dev/* for a device list. Plug and unplug the pi to see what tty device appears/disapears. This will give you the fcu address (flight control unit)
