Install mavlink_ros package in mavlink worspace created
Installed mavros github and followed installation instructions for kinetic
deleted all workspaces and reinstalled mavros package, which recompiles mavlink libraries as well
downloaded boost library and unzipped it, not sure if necessary for compiling c++ code, but after rebuilding mavros packages, they compiled with no errors
ran source devel/setup.sh in catkin_ws to source the mav_ros package
using pi3 and navio to broadcast wifi
use desktop computer that is connected with ethernet to the pi wifi
ssh to the pi from the desktop
downloaded APM Planner 2.0 as a ground control station onto personal laptop
connect laptop to pi wifi
run arductoper on pi with ip address of laptop to see pi connected to APM Planner
to run arducopter use command:
sudo ./ArduCopter.elf -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550 where the ip is the ip address of the device with the ground control station i.e. my laptop

Deleted mavros packages that was trying to compile from source code, because has bizarre to_string error in mavlink with no apparent fix. Posted in forum, so far no response. 

Decided to compile the binary from the mavros wiki. It downloaded. https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/master/mavros/README.md#installation

Attached pi/navio to desktop computer with USB to df13 cable. 

Had to figure out what the device was called. To troubelshoot this, look at ls /dev/* for a device list. Plug and unplug the pi to see what tty device appears/disapears. This will give you the fcu address (flight control unit)

rosrun mavros mavros_node _fcu_url:=/dev/tty0:921600 _gcs_url:=udp://@192.168.42.143

roslaunch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:=/dev/tty0:921600 gcs_url:=udp://@192.168.42.143



sudo -s
need to pgive yourself root access to launch the above commands of roslaunch mavros...


Decided to reinstall everything from scratch. Installed mavlink separately from binary found online: ros-kinetic-mavlink tar.gz file. Downloaded into workspace of mavros_ws; added the path to the mavlink to the python path with 
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$HOME/src:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.sh

Things didn't work at this point even though I had followed directions for installing mavlink separaetley and trued to build MAVROS. So I found some help on the forums: https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/issues/508 

catkin clean --all

catkin build --cmake-args -DMAVLINK_DIALECT=common <----this worked!!!!!

When running roslaunch mavros.... I got an error, so found answer in this forum: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/49. The answer was to update things using apt-get: 
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
source devel/setup.sh

trying to launch with different USBtty setting for flight control unit. Changed the default fcu_url to ttyUSB0 instead of ttyACM0, because that's the port my APM is on:

roslaunch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:=/dev/ttyUSB0:57600 gcs_url:=udp://@192.168.42.143
                                                                                                                                                                                            
Need to grant permissions to access the serial port:
 sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
 rosrun mavros mavsys rate --all 100

 To diagnose connection issues downloaded rqt_robot_plugins packages and run: rosrun rqt_runtime_monitor rqt_runtime_monitor

Connected odroid to pi3 with usb to df13 cable. 
Odroid has binary install of mav_ros and ros indigo 

using 404warehouse.net/2015/12/20/autopilot-offboard-control-using-mavros-package-on-ros/ for basic files and switching to px4 flight stack instead of APM flight stack, because APM flight stack didn't have enough messages to send setpoints and local positions
